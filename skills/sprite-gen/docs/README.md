# sprite-gen documentation index

One tool, four pipelines, one taxonomy. Every verb works alone or as a pipeline stage;
every doc below owns exactly one concern and the others point at it. Start with the
pipeline you are running, then follow its contract doc.

| Pipeline | Entry doc | Verbs |
|---|---|---|
| **A · atlas rows** — one still becomes a runtime sprite sheet | [run-contract.md](run-contract.md) | `prepare` → `gen` / `gen-set` → `extract` → `compose-atlas`; optional `curation` and recompose |
| **B · video → loop** — one still becomes transparent motion loops | [video-pipeline.md](video-pipeline.md) | `video-canvas` → `video` → `video-frames` → `video-loop`, `video-set` |
| **C · utilities** — imported images in, clean cuts out | [sheet-slicing.md](sheet-slicing.md) | `cutout`, `slice-sheet`, `unpack-atlas` |
| **D · post-processing** — finished sheets, refined | [recolor.md](recolor.md) | `recolor`, `recolor-palette`, `compose-layers`, breathing (compose), `export-pngs`, `export-aseprite` |

`sprite-gen --help` prints the same four pipelines and every verb grouped by domain; the
grouping is derived from `sprite_gen/_modules.py`, the one taxonomy table.
