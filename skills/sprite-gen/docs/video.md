# `sprite-gen video` — image to video with your own Grok login (engine SSoT)

> Owns: `sprite-gen video`: image to mp4 through Grok Imagine with the user's own credential · Index: [docs/README.md](README.md)

`sprite-gen video` animates one still into a short mp4 through **Grok Imagine**
(xAI `POST /v1/videos/generations`). It is the video counterpart of
[`sprite-gen gen`](gen.md): one call = one still (+ prompt) → one **verified** mp4
on disk plus a machine-readable report. The `grok-imagine-video` skill is a thin
shuttle over this command.

No credential is shipped with this repository. You bring your own, in one of two
forms, and every run reports which one it used.

## Setup — pick one credential

| `auth_source` | What you need | Billing | How to set it up |
|---|---|---|---|
| `grok-login` (default) | the `grok` CLI signed in once | your SuperGrok **Imagine quota** (no console spend) | install the grok CLI, run `grok login` (`--oauth` for a browser, `--device-auth` for a headless box). It writes `~/.grok/auth.json`; this tool only reads it. |
| `XAI_API_KEY` | an xAI console API key | console credit | `export XAI_API_KEY=xai-…` |

Resolution order is fixed: **`XAI_API_KEY` wins when set**, otherwise the grok
login file (`GROK_HOME` relocates `~/.grok`). Neither is a fallback for the other —
a set-but-empty `XAI_API_KEY` is an error, and with no key and no login the run
stops with both setup paths spelled out.

### The login token expires — and this tool does not refresh it

The grok CLI stores an OIDC access token that lasts about six hours
(2026-09-08 measurement: `expires_at` 10:56Z, refreshed to 18:26Z by the next grok
command). `sprite-gen video` reads `expires_at` **before uploading anything**; if
it has passed, the run fails with the refresh prescription instead of gambling on
a 403 mid-upload:

```
video: the grok login token expired at 2026-09-08T10:56:34Z (now …); nothing was uploaded.
  refresh it with any grok CLI command that reaches the API, e.g. `grok -p ok --output-format plain`,
  or sign in again with `grok login`. This tool never rewrites ~/.grok/auth.json itself.
```

Why not refresh it here: `auth.json` is the grok CLI's file, the refresh token in
it may rotate, and a second writer would break the login the user relies on
everywhere else. The same shape as `sprite-gen gen`'s `codex login status` gate.

### Why the direct API call and not Grok Build's `image_to_video` tool

Grok Build's built-in `image_to_video` tool posts without `output.upload_url`, and
on Zero-Data-Retention teams the API answers `HTTP 400 — Zero Data Retention teams
must provide output.upload_url for video generation`. The same login calling
`/v1/videos/generations` directly (no `output.upload_url`) succeeds and bills the
Imagine quota (verified 2026-08-22, re-verified 2026-09-08). So this engine calls
the API itself and never routes through the agent-side tool.

## CLI

```bash
sprite-gen video \
  --image still.png \                # PNG / JPEG / WebP; sent inline as a data URL
  --prompt "Camera locked. Gentle idle sway, tail flick." \   # or --prompt-file
  --out clip.mp4 \
  [--duration 6]                     # 1..15 seconds (default 6)
  [--resolution 720p]                # 480p | 720p | 1080p (default 720p)
  [--aspect-ratio 1:1]               # 1:1 16:9 9:16 4:3 3:4 3:2 2:3 (default: the still's ratio)
  [--audio | --no-audio]             # default: the API's default (audio on)
  [--model grok-imagine-video-1.5]
  [--report clip.report.json]
```

Backward-compatible wrapper: `$SPRITE_GEN_ROOT/.venv/bin/python $SPRITE_GEN_ROOT/scripts/generate_sprite_video.py …` (same args).

What happens, in order:

1. Validate the request (prompt, still, duration, resolution, aspect ratio) and
   resolve the credential — all before any network call.
2. `POST /v1/videos/generations` with `model`, `prompt`, `duration`, `resolution`,
   optional `aspect_ratio` / `generate_audio`, and `image.url` as a base64 data URL.
   A `401/403` names the credential source and its fix; any reply without a
   `request_id` fails with the API's own error text.
3. `GET /v1/videos/{request_id}` every 4 s until `status` is `done`. `failed`,
   `expired`, a non-2xx poll, or the timeout (`SPRITE_GEN_VIDEO_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`,
   default 600) fail loudly. Nothing is written on any failure path.
4. Download `video.url`, verify the bytes start with an mp4 `ftyp` box, then move
   the file into `--out` atomically (`.part` staging).

The report (`sprite-gen-video-report`) carries `auth_source`, `model`,
`request_id`, `bytes`, `host`, requested/reported duration, resolution, aspect
ratio, audio flag, `elapsed_seconds`, and `polls`. **Tokens and download URLs are
never printed or written** — only the download host (`vidgen.x.ai`).

## Quotas and limits

- Imagine quota is a weekly SuperGrok allowance; when it is exhausted the API
  refuses the POST and the run fails with that message (no retry loop here).
- Duration 1–15 s, resolutions 480p/720p/1080p, the seven aspect ratios above —
  from the xAI video docs as of 2026-09-08. A value outside those is rejected
  locally before the call.
- Output is whatever the model returns (typically H.264 mp4 with audio unless
  `--no-audio`). Downstream frame extraction is a separate step and not part of
  this command.
